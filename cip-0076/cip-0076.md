## Abstract:

Hypernative as a Super Validator with a Weight of 1

## About Applicant:

Hypernative is a leading blockchain security and monitoring platform, delivering **real-time on-chain and off-chain threat detection, anomaly detection, and governance risk monitoring.** Its products are trusted by protocols, foundations, and institutional actors seeking resilient risk mitigation in decentralized environments.

With a global team of engineers, researchers, and data scientists, Hypernative continuously monitors blockchain networks, identifies risks in real time, and integrates with client systems for proactive defense.

Key strengths Hypernative brings to Canton include:
* Proven track record of **real-time threat detection** across multiple ecosystems.
* Enterprise-grade **monitoring infrastructure** for institutional adoption.
* Deep expertise in **blockchain forensics, detection modeling, and incident response.**
* **Trusted partnerships** with foundations, auditors, and institutional actors.
* APIs, dashboards, and integration-ready infrastructure to support compliance and governance.

## Deliverables for full SV Reward:

| Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria | Deadline | Weight Earned |
|-------------|---------------------|----------|---------------|
| Hypernative provides proactive network monitoring solution | •  Any Canton network member can utilize Hypernative services for Canton blockchain event monitoring. <br> •  Measured by ability to monitor and detect balance changes and transfers for Canton Coin including activity for incoming/outgoing transfers and ability to provide alerts generated on thresholds/patterns  <br> •  At least one entity active on the Canton Network subscribed to monitoring alerts from Hypernative for Canton Network activity (Reference Appendix III, Milestone 5\)| +180 Days from CIP Approval | 1 |

## SV Reward Mechanics: 
* An `extraBeneficiary` PartyID associated with the ‘escrowed’ Super Validator will be setup by the GSF with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight. 
    * The Applicant is responsible for coordinating the process of setting up the escrowed weights with the GSF and the operator of the GSF SV node.
    * The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV
    * The escrow SV will NOT mint rewards on a block by block basis
    * All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool
* ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow GSF to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator
* Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group
    * Applicant is required to present a calculation for number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting the requirements of the milestone
* If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing List
    * The GSF will update the `extraBeneficiary` to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator. 
    * ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the calculation approved by the Tokenomics working group.
   
* If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline
    * Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF 
    * Remaining SV Weight assigned to the `extraBeneficiary` SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.
    * The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards 
* Applicant is subject to CIP-0045 : SV Operating Requirements
    * If, at any time, the Applicant has been rewarded SV Weight > 2.5, they are required to operate their SV within 6 months of crossing that Weight. This SV node will join the network with an SV weight of zero (0) and may add weights as the SV completes the milestones listed in this CIP.
