## Abstract

- Allow existing Validator operators to create up to 10 additional Validators for third-party participants.
- Redirect new individual Validator applicants to approved existing operators.
## Specification

- Existing Validator operators will be authorized to create up to 10 additional Validators for third-party participants. Once an existing Validator operator has spun up the ten (10) allotted nodes, they can request an additional alottment from the Tokenomics committee. 
- Third-party applicants wishing to run a Validator will be redirected to an existing operator.
-Whitelisting requests, if the node will not share an existing IP address, will come from the existing Validator operator who sponsors the new node
In the case that the onboarded node receives its own IP address in the whitelist, the whitelist will indicate the Validator Operator as the responsible party for the node. 
-Credit for onboarding the Validator goes to the sponsoring Validator Operator
-The Validator onboarding secret will be issued by a Super Validator, as before.
- Pre-approved operators, such as Kiln, Dfns and Copper, who have already been granted the right to operate up to 30 validator nodes, will retain that right.
- Operators will be given discretion in onboarding third-party Validator nodes. After reaching the limit of ten additional nodes onboarded through this process, these operators may request additional node hosting permissions from the GSF Tokenomics committee. 
- This policy ensures a structured and scalable approach to Validator expansion while maintaining network integrity and supportability.
- The [application process](https://sync.global/validator-request/) will remain in place for requests to become a Validator Operator.

## Motivation

- As interest in the network grows, there is increasing demand from individuals wanting to become Validators. However, onboarding independent Validators without oversight could introduce operational and security risks. This proposal establishes a controlled mechanism for growth, leveraging existing trusted operators to facilitate expansion while maintaining an orderly network.
- Maintain a controlled, trusted, and orderly network expansion.


## Rationale

The current approach ensures:
- Network stability by limiting Validator growth to approved operators.
- A direct point of contact for any network-related issues.
- A structured expansion process that aligns with the network’s steady rollout.
- Efficient use of existing operators' expertise and infrastructure.

Alternative approaches, such as an open application process, were considered but deemed too difficult to manage at this stage. This proposal strikes a balance between controlled growth and decentralization.


## Backwards compatibility

This proposal does not introduce any backwards incompatibilities. It only modifies the policy for onboarding new Validators.

## Reference implementation

No code changes are required for this proposal. Implementation involves updating policy documentation and communicating guidelines to existing Validator operators.
