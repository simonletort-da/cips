## Milestone Mechanics

* The GSF Tokenomics committee commits to deliberate each proposed participant and clearly notify Taurus if the participant would count against the Adoption Incentives
* Taurus will meet with the GSF Tokenomics committee once every 60 days and provide a progress report towards stated deliverables

## SV Reward Mechanics

* An `extraBeneficiary` PartyID associated with the ‘escrowed’ Super Validator will be setup by the GSF with an SV Weight at the maximum earnable weight in the CIP that granted rights to that Super Validator.
  * The Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with the operation of the escrow SV
  * The escrow SV will NOT mint rewards on a block by block basis
  * All escrow SV rewards will go to the Unclaimed Rewards pool
* ⅔ of the Super Validator Operators will update their configurations to allow GSF to host the full weight to be earned by the given Super Validator
* Applicant is required to present proof of successful completed milestones to the Tokenomics Working Group
  * Applicant is required to present a calculation for number of Canton Coin it should earn for meeting the requirements of the milestone
* If the Tokenomics Working Group agrees the milestone has been met and agrees with the calculation, an announcement will be sent via the Tokenomics-Announce mailing List
  * The GSF will update the `extraBeneficiary` to an active PartyID controlled by that Super Validator. 
  * ⅔ of Super Validator Operators will then assign a portion of the Unclaimed Rewards to be minted by the Applicant’s Validator, based on the calculation approved by the Tokenomics working group.
* If any milestones and associated rewards are not achieved by the deadline
  * Applicant will be notified they have not met a deliverable by the GSF
  * Remaining SV Weight assigned to the `extraBeneficiary` SV will be removed from the GSF node configuration, and the total SV weight of the GSF SV node will be reduced by the same amount by a vote of the Super Validators.
  * The Tokenomics Working Group will make a recommendation to the SVs on what to do with the Unclaimed Rewards
* Applicant is subject to CIP-0045 : SV Operating Requirements
  * If, at any time, the Applicant has been rewarded SV Weight > 2.5, they are required to operate their SV within 6 months of crossing that Weight. This SV node will join the network with an SV weight of zero (0) and may add weights as the SV completes the milestones listed in this CIP.
